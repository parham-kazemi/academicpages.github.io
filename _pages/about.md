Hi! I am Parham, a MASc Electrical and Computer Engineering student at McMaster University, one of the top 4 universities in Canada. I am working in the intersection of Optical Wireless Communications and Information Theory in the FOCAL group under the supervision of Prof. Steve Hranilovic. My project title is "Probabilistic shaping for optical wireless intensity channels," which is roughly a topic on modulation and coding for Intensity Modulation Direct Detection(IM/DD) channels.

Before this, I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Tehran in July 2022, and my bachelor project was "Extracting Singer Vocal From a Music Using Bind Source Separation."

Hi! I am Parham, a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of Tehran. My major is communications, and I passed some courses in this category such as Digital Communications, Wireless Communications, DSP, Blind Source Separation, Operations Research, Antenna I, Microwave I, and Electromagnetic Fields and Waves. At the moment, I am working on my bachelor project that is "Extracting Singer Vocal From Music Using Bind Source Separation," under supervision of Dr. Saeed Akhavan Behabadi. 
<br />
<br /> 
My research interests include wireless communications, signal and image processing, and coding and information theory. Also, I like biomedical engineering, and its new advancements really impress me.
<br />
<br />
Before coming to University of Tehran, I spent my high school at Allameh Helli High School, affiliated with the National Organization for the Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET), and I got my high school diploma in mathematics and physics major there. Then I took part in Nationwide Iranian University Entrance Exam in Mathematics and Physics and ranked 291 out of about 140,0000 competitors(top 0.2%), thus I got the chance to study at the University of Tehran, one of the most prestigious universities in Iran.
