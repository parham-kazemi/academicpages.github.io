Hi! I am Parham, a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of Tehran. My major is communications, and I passed some courses in this category such as Digital Communications, Wireless Communications, DSP, Blind Source Separation, Operations Research, Antenna I, Microwave I, and Electromagnetic Fields and Waves. At the moment, I am working on my bachelor project that is "Extracting Singer Vocal From Music Using Bind Source Separation," under supervision of Dr. Saeed Akhavan Behabadi. 
<br />
<br /> 
My research interests include wireless communications, signal and image processing, and coding and information theory. Also, I like biomedical engineering, and its new advancements really impress me.
<br />
<br />
Before coming to University of Theran, I spent my high school at Allameh Helli High School, affiliated with the National Organization for the Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET), and I got my high school diploma in mathematics and physics major there. Then I took part in Nationwide Iranian University Entrance Exam in Mathematics and Physics and ranked 291 out of about 140,0000 competitors(top 0.2%), thus I got the chance to study at the University of Tehran, one of the most prestigious universities in Iran.
