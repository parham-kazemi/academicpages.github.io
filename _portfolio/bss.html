• Implemented different ICA algorithms(such as FastICA) on a dataset estimate separated sources.
• Implemented single/multi-channel blind source deconvolution.
• Implemented dictionary learning algorithms(MOD and K-SVD) for sparse representation of signals.
• Implemented an LDA classifier for an EEG dataset based on the CSP approach.
• Implemented CCA approach in the detection of Stimulation frequency of SSVEP-based BCI.
• Implemented MUSIC and Beamforming approach on a vertical uniform array.
