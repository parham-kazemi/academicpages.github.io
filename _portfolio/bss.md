I did the following computer assignments by MATLAB programming in spring 2021:

* Implemented different ICA algorithms(such as FastICA) on a dataset estimate separated sources.
* Implemented single/multi-channel blind source deconvolution.
* Implemented dictionary learning algorithms(MOD and K-SVD) for sparse representation of signals.
* Implemented an LDA classifier for an EEG dataset based on the CSP approach.
* Implemented CCA approach in the detection of Stimulation frequency of SSVEP-based BCI.
* Implemented MUSIC and Beamforming approach on a vertical uniform array.
