I did the following computer assignments by MATLAB programming in spring 2021:

* Retrieved source signals from a set of noisy observations using different ICA algorithms
     1. minimizing Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence based on estimating score function, deflation approach, and equivariant algorithm
     2. maximizing kurtosis function based on deflation approach, fixed-point approach, and FastICA).
* Implemented single-channel and multi-channel blind source deconvolution in both time domain and frequency domain.
* Implemented dictionary learning algorithms(MOD and K-SVD) for sparse representation of signals.
* Generated an LDA classifier for an EEG dataset based on the Common Spatial Pattern(CSP) approach.
* Performed CCA approach in stimulation frequency detection of SSVEP-based BCI.
* Implemented MUSIC and Beamforming approach on a vertical uniform array.
