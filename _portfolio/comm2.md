I simulated digital modulation techniques such as PAM, QAM, PSK, DBPSK, and FSK(both coherent and non-coherent detection) with various detailed considerations using MATLAB:
  1. Implemented Gray coding, pulse shaping, symbol to bit converting and vice versa
  2. Considering effect of channel phase offset and channel delay ; 
  3. Designed correlator, matched filter, and minimum-distance detector;
  4. Calculated bit error rate for different SNRs
