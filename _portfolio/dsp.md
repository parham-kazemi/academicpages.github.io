I implemented some small computer assignment by MATLAB and its toolboxes in fall 2020 as follow:

* Estimated pulse rate by processing an ECG dataset.
* Implemented Audio Processing in Cepstrum domain and Image Compression using DCT.
* Designed FIR filter to remove noise from the speech signal and Implemented filters on images using kernel matrix.
