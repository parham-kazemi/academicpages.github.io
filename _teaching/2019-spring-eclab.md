An undergraduate-level Laboratory course handled by [Dr. Hossein Iman-Eini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ta7REBYAAAAJ&hl=en/)  at the University of Tehran, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in spring 2019

In this lab, I helped electrical and computer engineering students understand the concepts of their experiments and then implement the demanded passive circuits.
